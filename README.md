###Windows 10 "Local Administrator Cannot Run This Application" Fix

Windows 10 doesn't allow local administrators to open up Windows applications (Edge, Calculator, Mail, etc) by default. This script solves this issue by changing some registry settings.

**Note: Must run as local administrator

###Windows 10 UAC Quick Change

In some instances, Windows 10 will automatically change UAC to "Never Notify" which can cause the "Local Administrator Cannot Run This Application" issue. This changes the UAC back to level 2 which fixes this issue.

###Search and Replace

As an addon to the tutorial I did, I wanted to make a script that allowed you to choose a file, search the file for a word and replace all instances of that word.
